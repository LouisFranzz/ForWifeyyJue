            <h4>Lyrics:</h4>
            <p>
            
We were both young when I first saw you<br>
I close my eyes and the flashback starts<br>
I'm standin' there<br>
On a balcony in summer air<br>
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns<br>
See you make your way through the crowd<br>
And say, "Hello"<br>
Little did I know<br>
That you were Romeo, you were throwin' pebbles<br>
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"<br>
And I was cryin' on the staircase<br>
Beggin' you, "Please don't go," and I said<br>
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone<br>
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run<br>
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess<br>
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"<br>
So I sneak out to the garden to see you<br>
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew<br>
So close your eyes<br>
Escape this town for a little while, oh oh<br>
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter<br>
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"<br>
But you were everything to me<br>
I was beggin' you, "Please don't go," and I said<br>
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone<br>
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run<br>
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess<br>
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"<br>
Romeo, save me, they're tryna tell me how to feel<br>
This love is difficult, but it's real<br>
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess<br>
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"<br>
Oh, oh<br>
I got tired of waiting<br>
Wonderin' if you were ever comin' around<br>
My faith in you was fading<br>
When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said<br>
Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone<br>
I keep waiting for you, but you never come<br>
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think<br>
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring<br>
And said, "Marry me, Juliet<br>
You'll never have to be alone<br>
I love you and that's all I really know<br>
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress<br>
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"<br>
Oh, oh, oh<br>
Oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you<br>
